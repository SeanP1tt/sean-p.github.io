            Welcome to my website where I'll show a picture of something random. 
        </p>

        
        <h3>Assignment 1</h3>
        <p>
            In order to give you practice constructing websites, I want you to try to make a page similar to this, but with your own take on it. You can make a webpage about yourself, a business idea you've had, or even something you have interest in (like cats).
            
        </p>
        <!-- Add as many images on the page as you want -->
                    <a href="screenshots/quick-edit.png">
            <img alt="A screenshot showing CSS Quick Edit" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRjOqKI0kZG7nIV2w7AFRWfPUGiqeM0J26TbCp8irR1jZiNG556" /> 
        </a> <!-- adding  a link around the image makes it clickable -->
        
        <p>
            The possibilities are endless. (I don't like cats that much, this was just the quickest example). 
        </p>
        
        <h2>Be Sure to Inspect This Webpage to See How it was Built</h2>
        
        <br> <!-- this is a line break tag which adds a line of space between the p tag above and below the break -->
        
        <p>All you need to do is add 5 unique tags to an html page excluding the body, head, and html tags. You can add as much text as you want (It will make the page look better if you add more, but proper spacing is also important). Try to divide the text amongst different paragraph tags or even using headers between differen topics amongst the page.</p>
        
        <p>
            <em>Html is the easy part.</em> <!-- this is an emphasis tag which italicizes text -->
            So when you're done try adding a css page and styling some of the elements. I'll provide an example stylesheet as well for you to add to and tweak. 
            
        </p>
        
        <!--

        -->
        
        
        
        <h5>Here are some resources for you to check out as well:</h5> <!-- the 2nd smallest header tag. H1 is the biggest -->

        </ul>
        
        <p> Remember you can learn a lot by looking at other peoples work. Although it may be overwhelming, try looking at nicely designed websites and try to understand how they were made by inspecting the page as you continue to learn.</p>
        
        
        <p> Also all work being done now is only local to your computer. Although you are viewing it in a web browser no one else, but you can view this file without you sharing it with them. </p>
